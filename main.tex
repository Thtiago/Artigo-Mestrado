\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{P}{ower} line communication (PLC\acused{PLC}) systems have been investigated by academic and industry sectors worldwide over the past decades because %Recently, these systems have became attractive solutions for data communication once they can be deployed over the existing electric power systems' infrastructure. 
electric power grids are ubiquitous. Some researches have pointed out that the deployment and operational costs related to \ac{PLC} systems can be low \cite{Hrasnica:PLC_design, Dib}, which constitute relevant advantages in favor of \ac{PLC} systems. As a consequence, \ac{PLC} systems are being applied for supporting Smart Grids, the Internet of Things, and Industry $4.0$. On the other hand, electric power grids were not originally designed for data communication purposes and, as a consequence, the propagation of information carrying signals through power lines may suffer severe attenuation and frequency-selective fading due to the use of unshielded conductors and the existence of impedance mismatching. Also, thes signals can be corrupted by the high-power impulsive noise presence and the use of electromagnetically unshielded power lines may result in significant interference with wireless systems operating in the same frequency band. %In addition, the topology diversity of the electric power grids and the fact that power lines can act as antennas results that the propagating signal may be exposed to significant influence from the radio frequency (RF) signals, which makes the electric power grids a challenging media for data communication.  

Therefore, the characterization and modeling of \ac{PLC} channels are mandatory tasks to be \textit{a priori} accomplished for fostering advances in \ac{PLC} systems. The \ac{PLC} channels are categorized in low-voltage (indoor or outdoor) \cite{Zhai:low}, medium-voltage (outdoor and underground) \cite{Lazaropoulos} or high-voltage (outdoor) \cite{Zajc}. Focusing on the indoor electric power grids, recent research efforts toward the characterization and modeling may be organized as follows: residential or commercial buildings, known as in-home or in-building \cite{Amirshahi:PLC,Tlich:Indoor} and in-vehicles (i.e., cars \cite{Vallejo:Vehicle_PLC}, ships \cite{Barmada:Ships_PLC}, and aircrafts \cite{Jones:Aircraft_PLC,Andrey2016}). %In Brazil, broadband \ac{PLC} systems must operate in the frequency band delimited by $1.7$ and $50$~MHz \cite{Anatel:PLC}. However, some contributions pointed out that the frequency band between $0$ and $500$~MHz may be used by future generation of \ac{PLC} systems \cite{Luis:doc,zeddam1}. %Together with the frequency bandwidth expansion of these systems, several improvements are being investigated, such as those obtained by cooperative communication \cite{mateus:2018,Michelle2016,Valencia2014,Roberto2015}.

Regarding in-home environments, \cite{Canete:Model} discussed the modeling of in-home \ac{PLC} channels in Spain in the frequency band between $1.705$ and $30$~MHz, while \cite{Canete:PLC} evaluated some features, such as delay spread, \ac{ACG} and \ac{CB}. Also, \cite{Cortes:PLC} discussed the normal/log-normal nature of delay spread and \ac{ACG}. In \cite{GalliUS,Galli:Wireline}, the in-home \ac{PLC} channels in some urban and suburban United States (US) residences were characterized in terms of \ac{ACG} and \ac{RMS-DS}, considering the frequency band from $2$ to $30$~MHz. In \cite{Tlich:Indoor}, a characterization of in-home \ac{PLC} channels was performed in some urban and suburban residences in France, describing values of \ac{CB} and time-delay parameters in the frequency band from $30$~kHz to $100$~MHz. Recently, \cite{Thiago:Characterization} has analyzed the \ac{CFR}, \ac{ACA}, \ac{RMS-DS}, \ac{CB}, and \ac{CT} of Brazilian in-home \ac{PLC} channels when the frequency band ranges from $1.7$ up to $100$~MHz.  Moreover, the Log-normal and rayleigh distributions are being adopted for modeling \ac{CFR} magnitude \cite{Galli:Wireline,RayleighPLC}; however, the lack of agreement about these models, \cite{Cortes:PLC}, brings our attention to the necessity of further investigations towards the \ac{CFR} of in-home \ac{PLC} channels. 

%As the number of wireless users and service stations have significantly increased in the last decades, more research efforts to correctly characterize and model \ac{WLC} channels are being carried out. Concerning \ac{WLC}, it is important to point out having or not line-of-sight propagation, the increasing signal attenuation along with both distance and carrier frequency, the susceptibility to interference among two or more telecommunication systems operating in the same frequency band, the scarcity of spectrum, and vulnerability to non-authorized access constitute a relevant set of problems. %Also, the transmitted signal through the air suffers three different propagation effects: reflection, scattering, and diffraction \cite{Guze}. 
%The existing problems in \ac{WLC} systems are associated with the distortions introduced by the aforementioned channels effects and co-channel interference, which is primarily generated from uncoordinated transmissions \cite{Sayed2015}. In this context, the \ac{WLC} channel characterization and modeling have also attracted attention since they can accelerate the development of new and suitable \ac{WLC} systems. 

A comparison between \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} media shows distinct characteristics that might be jointly exploited for improving the telecommunication systems performance in terms of reliability, data rate, security, coverage, and flexibility in the physical and link layers \cite{Dib,Victor2017,Victor2018}. Aiming to proof this claim, the existing diversity between \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} media in the same frequency band was investigated in \cite{thiago:hyb, thiago:hyb2, Victor2016, Leo2016}. However, the first investigation of it dates back to the very beginning of the XX Century \cite{Mischa} but the advances in \ac{WLC} systems during the following decades drastically reduced the interests in this kind of hybrid data communication. Only at the beginning of the XXI Century, around one century after its initial investigation, \cite{thiago:hyb} revisited these channels. As it was initially proposed, it makes use of unshielded power lines to allow \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} devices, operating in the same frequency band, communicate to each other. %Besides, \cite{thiago:hyb} discussed important results and analyses regarding the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels, such as symmetry of \ac{CFR} magnitudes, \ac{ACA}, \ac{CB}, \ac{RMS-DS}, \ac{CT} and channel capacity.
This kind of hybrid channels assume 
the concatenation of \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} channels, which results in the so-called \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} systems. Taking a look at the literature, we can see a lack of statistical model for  the \ac{CFR} of \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels.%The hybrid \ac{PLC}/\ac{WLC} system have also been investigated as an alternative to improve data communication performance \cite{Victor2017,Sayed2014} since it can take advantage of both electric power grids and air to improve data rate and reliability between source and destination nodes under several circumstances, see \cite{Dib} for instance. In such data communication systems, electric power grids and wireless media are used simultaneously in a cooperatively to maximize the available channel resources and, as a consequence, to fulfill data communication constraints.

Aiming to address this issue, we focuses on the statistical characterization and modeling of the magnitudes of \acp{CFR} of Brazilian broadband in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channel. %In this context, an enhanced statistical modeling method, which emerged from the drawbacks associated with the methodology introduced in \cite{Luis:AI,Luis:doc}, is proposed. Furthermore, the statistical characterization and modeling results, based on data sets of measured \acp{CFR} of in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels, are detailed. %The mentioned data sets were acquired during a measurement campaign performed in several Brazilian residences, see more information about the measurement campaign in \cite{Thiago:Characterization,thiago:hyb,thiago:hyb2,thiago:doc}. 
The covered frequency band is between $1.7$ and $100$~MHz since it comprises Brazilian, European and US telecommunication regulations for broadband \ac{PLC} systems. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The discussion of an enhanced statistical modeling method, which is the improved version of that one introduced in \cite{Luis:AI,Luis:doc}. This method searches for the most suitable statistical distribution, according to the adopted criteria, to model the \ac{CFR} magnitudes of in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels.
	
	\item The introduction of statistical models for the magnitude of Brazilian in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels, which were acquired during a measurement campaign carried out in several Brazilian residences.% and took into account the frequency band between $1.7$ and $100$~MHz. %Also, presentation of magnitude models for these channels and comparison existing \ac{PLC} channels in the. 
\end{itemize}
Based on the numerical analyses, the following statements apply:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The enhanced statistical modeling method is suitable for statistically modeling random processes, such as the magnitudes of frequency responses of in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels. Moreover, in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels are random processes in which their parameters frequency dependent. In other words, they are non-stationary random processes in the frequency domain. 
    \item Magnitudes of in-home \ac{PLC} channels are better modeled by a Beta random process, while the in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels are better modeled by a Log-normal random process. 
\end{itemize}

This paper is organized as follows: Section II addresses the problem formulation; Section III describes the methodology to obtain the statistical model; Section IV discusses the numerical results; and Section V states concluding remarks.

\section{Problem Formulation}

Fig. \ref{PLCchannel} shows the block diagram of a \ac{PLC} system. In this figure, $T_x$ and $R_x$ represent the data communication's transmitter and receiver, respectively. The \ac{PLC} system is designed for data communication in the frequency band delimited by $0$ and $B$~Hz (i.e., bandlimited and baseband data communication). The electric power grid is a linear and time-varying system, eventually it can be modeled as a random process. The received signal is expressed as
\begin{equation} \label{received signal}
Y_P(t) = \tilde{Y}_P(t)+V_P(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} h_P(t,\tau) X(\tau) d\tau + V_P(t),
\end{equation}
where $X(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ is the transmitted signal, modeled as a wide sense stationary stochastic process; $h_P(t,\tau)\in \mathbb{R}$ is the time-varying \ac{CIR}% at instant $t$, related to an impulse applied to the \ac{PLC} channel at the instant $\tau$
, which models the propagation of the transmitted signal through the electric power grid; $V_P(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ is the additive noise modeled as a wide sense stationary random process; and $\tilde{Y}_P(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ and $Y_P(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ denote wide sense stationary random processes for the free-of-noise received signal and the received signal, respectively.

Fig. \ref{Hybchannel} shows the block diagram for the \ac{PLC}-wireless system, in which \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} channels are employed in cascade, without an intermediate data communication node between them. As this figure portrays, \ac{PLC} devices are connected to electric power grids through a coupling circuit while the \ac{WLC} devices are connected to the air through an antenna. Both devices directly communicate with each other because they operate in the same frequency band. The received signals at the input of the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channel is expressed as
\begin{equation} \label{received signal2}
Y_{PW}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} h_{PW}(t,\tau) X(\tau) d\tau + V_{PW}(t),
\end{equation}
for the signal propagation from the \ac{PLC} device to the \ac{WLC} device (i.e., \ac{PLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{WLC} direction), and
\begin{equation} \label{received signal3}
Y_{WP}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} h_{WP}(t,\tau) X(\tau) d\tau + V_{WP}(t),
\end{equation}
for the reverse direction (i.e., \ac{WLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{PLC} direction). In (\ref{received signal2})-(\ref{received signal3}),  $X(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ is the transmitted signal modeled as a wide sense stationary stochastic process; $h_{PW}(t,\tau)\in \mathbb{R}$ and $h_{WP}(t,\tau)\in \mathbb{R}$ denote the \acp{CIR} when an impulse at the instant $\tau$ is applied to the channel defined by the \ac{PLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{WLC} and \ac{WLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{PLC} directions, respectively; $V_{PW}(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ and $V_{WP}(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ are, respectively, the \ac{WLC} and \ac{PLC} additive noise components, modeled as two different wide sense stationary random processes when the \ac{PLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{WLC} and \ac{WLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{PLC} directions take place; $Y_{PW}(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ and ${Y}_{WP}(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ are wide sense stationary random processes denoting the received signals, respectively, in the \ac{PLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{WLC} and \ac{WLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{PLC} directions.

Note that the symmetry of\acp{CFR} of the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC}  channels takes place when the transmitter and the receiver have the same access impedance \cite{thiago:hyb}. Mathematically, $h_{PW}(t,\tau)=h_{WP}(t,\tau)$ agrees with the results presented in \cite{Galli:indoor}, which focuses only on \ac{PLC} channels. Due to the specific characteristics of each media (e.g., power line and air), the symmetry property does not hold true for the additive noises $V_{PW}(t)$ and $V_{WP}(t)$ \cite{thiago:hyb}. 

Given back to \ac{PLC} systems, the random \ac{LPTV} behavior of \ac{PLC} channels, $h_P(t,\tau)$, defines a cyclostationary stochastic random process with a period equal to a half of the mains frequency \cite{Colen:TCRA}. Based on the knowledge of the coherence time, $T_c \in \mathbb{R}_+$, of the \ac{PLC} channels, the mains cycle ($50$~Hz or $60$~Hz) can be divided into microslots of time interval duration equal to $T_m\in \mathbb{R}_+|T_m < T_c$ and, as a consequence, the \ac{PLC} channels can be modeled as \ac{LTI} during the time interval duration of one microslot \cite{Colen2016}. In other words, the \ac{CIR} of a \ac{PLC} channel during the $i^{th}$ microslot can be expressed as
\begin{equation} \label{discreteh}
h_{P,i}(t),~\forall~t \in [iT_{m}, (i+1)T_{m}] \mid T_{m} \le T_{c}.
\end{equation}
Similar to \ac{PLC} systems, the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} systems operates in the baseband. Therefore, the aforementioned mathematical formulation also apply to the \acp{CIR} of the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels. For the sake of simplicity, from now on, we drop the index $i$ for the sake of simplicity. The discrete-time representation of the \ac{CIR} of the \ac{PLC} or \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channel in a single microslot is given by
\begin{equation} \label{discreteCFR}
h[n] = h_{a}(t)|_{t=nT_s} , n = 0,1, \ldots, L_h-1, 
\end{equation}
where $a\in \{P, WP, PW \}$, $L_{h}$ is the length of the $a^{th}$ \ac{LTI} channel, $T_s=1/f_s$ is the sampling period and $f_s=2B$~Hz is the sampling frequency. By applying the \ac{HS-OFDM} scheme, which is supposed to operate in the baseband, we assume that the length of the an \ac{HS-OFDM} symbol is ($2N$) and $L_{cp} \geq L_h-1$, in which $L_{cp}$ stands for the length of cyclic prefix. Moreover, $B/N \le B_{c,a}$, in which $B_{c,a}$ is the coherence bandwidth of the $a^{th}$ \ac{LTI} channel. To work with $N$ subcarriers in the \ac{HS-OFDM} scheme, the zero padding has to be appended to $\{h[n]\}$. Note that ${\bf h}=[h_0 h_1 \ldots h_{L_h-1}]^T$ is such that $h_n=h[n]$ and 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{W}_{2N}  \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}_{L_h} \\ \mathbf{0}_{(2N-L_{cp})\times L_{h}} \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{h},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{W}_{2N} \in \mathbb{C}^{2N\times 2N}$ denotes the $2N \times 2N$-size \ac{DFT} matrix, $ \mathbf{I}_{L_h} \in \mathbb{R}^{L_h\times L_h}$ denotes an $L_h\times L_h$-size identity matrix, and $ \mathbf{0}_{(2N-L_{cp})\times L_{h}} $ is an $ (2N-L_{cp})\times L_{h}$ null matrix. The $k^{th}$ element of the vector $\mathbf{H}=[H_0 H_1 \ldots H_{2N-1}]^T \in \mathbb{C}^{2N\times 1}$ may be expressed in the polar form as $H_k=|H_k|\exp(j \Theta_k)$, in which $|.|$ denotes the absolute value and $\Theta_k$ is the phase of $H_k$. Since the \ac{CIR} of the $a^{th}$ channel is real-valued, it means that \ac{CFR} posses the hermitian symmetry property and, as a consequence, the first half of samples of the \ac{CFR} are sufficient for representing the whole $a^{th}$ channel. We assume that the vectors $|{\bf H}|\triangleq [|H_0||H_1|\ldots |H_{N-1}|]^T$ and ${\bf \Theta}\triangleq[\Theta_0\Theta_1\ldots \Theta_{N-1}]^T$ define two distinct random processes that represent, respectively, the magnitude and phase of the first half of the vector $\mathbf{H}$. It is important to emphasize that the nature of the $a^{th}$ channel indicates that the vectors $|{\bf H}|$ and ${\bf \Theta}$ are non-stationary and correlated random processes. 
 
Note that the knowledge of magnitude of \ac{CFR} magnitude %the one of the squared magnitude (i.e.,  $|{\bf H}|^2\triangleq[|H_0|^2|H_1|^2\ldots |H_{N-1}|^2]^T$) of \acp{CFR} 
allows us to derive closed-form expressions for several information theory aspects of data communication channels. In this regard, let us assume that the $k^{th}$ \ac{r.va.} belonging to the magnitude random processes (i.e., the element $|H_k|$) is modeled by an statistical distribution owing a set of parameters represented by $\mathcal{C}_{|H|_k} = \{ \alpha_{1}[k], \cdots, \alpha_{U}[k] \}$, which is constituted by $U \in \mathbb{N}^*$ parameters. Note that $\alpha_{u}[k] \in \mathbb{R}$ is the $u^{th}$ parameter associated with the chosen statistical distribution that offers the best description of the $k^{th}$ element of the vector $|{\bf H}|$.

Given the aforementioned formulation, the following research questions arise: \textit{What kind of statistical distributions are suitable for modeling the random vector $|{\bf H}|$? Could we state that $|{\bf H}|$ is a stationary random process?} The following sections try to answer these challenging research questions.

\section{Statistical Modeling Methodology}

This section describes an enhanced statistical modeling method, which is based on the one introduced in \cite{Luis:AI}, for modeling \ac{CFR} magnitudes of \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels. Note that the enhancement is related to the use of better interpolation technique. To do so, we assume that the elements of \ac{r.v.} ${\bf |H|}$ are uncorrelated random variables. 

Moreover, we need to come up with the statistical model of parameters of $|H(e^{j\omega})|$, which is the discrete-time Fourier transform of $h(t)$. To do so, a technique capable of yielding a suitable interpolation with a reduced number of parameters and without presenting edge effects, such as that ones reported in \cite{Luis:AI}, is a very convenient solution. In fact, standard interpolation technique may demand a large number of parameters \cite{mitra}. 

Regarding the chosen statistical distribution, let us assume  $\alpha_u (\omega) = F_u(\omega; \alpha_{u}[0], \cdots, \alpha_{u}[N-1])$, in which $\omega \in [0,2\pi)$, is such that $\alpha_{u}[k] = F_u(2\pi k/N; \alpha_{u}[0], \cdots, \alpha_{u}[N-1]),u=1,\cdots,U$. Then the problem of interpolation consists of finding an approximation $P_u(\omega)$ for the function $F_u(\omega)$ within the defined class of functions, in the way that it can obtain the same values at the points $\omega_k = 2\pi k/N$ (i.e., $F_u(\omega_k)=P_u(\omega_k)$). The Lagrange Interpolation is the direct solution to obtain $P_u(\omega)$; however, the degree of interpolating Lagrange polynomial is strictly related to the amount of points (nodes)  $\omega_k = 2\pi k/N$, which makes the problems with high number of input data difficult to solve. The use of Splines can mitigate this problem once it divides the interval into $L$ subintervals, constructs the interpolating polynomial $P_{u,l}(\omega),l=1,\cdots,L$, in the $l^{th}$ subinterval separately and groups the resulting interpolation polynomials to obtain $P_u(\omega)$. Another advantage of Splines is their capacity of avoiding the Runge's phenomenon. This contribution applies the cubic Splines \cite{Spline} due to their characteristics of not needing to use uniform intervals of interpolation, producing smoother curves, interpolating the bounds of the intervals and generating a continuous curve over the chosen frequency subband.  

The statistical modeling can be summarized in searching for the statistical distributions offering the best fits to a data set obtained from a measuring campaign (i.e., measured \ac{CFR} estimates). It means that the type of statistical distribution together with its parameters are the modeling information for each element of the \ac{r.v.}  ${\bf |H|}$. %the proposed enhanced statistical modeling method  consists in testing several statistical distributions to model each element of the \ac{r.v.} $\bf |H|$, choosing the best statistical distribution by adopting well-established criteria and performing the interpolation by using the Splines technique. 
the following steps implement the enhanced statistical modeling method:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Step \#1}: Model all elements of the \ac{r.v.} $\bf |H|$ with the set of statistical distributions that addressed the characteristics of its elements. Note that ${\bf |H|} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{N\times 1}|0 \leq {|H_k|} \leq 1$ determines the suitability of a set of statistical distributions for modeling the magnitude component.
	\item \textbf{Step \#2}: Appraise the set of statistical distributions for each element of the \ac{r.v.} $\bf |H|$. We apply the majority vote rule \cite{vote} over four chosen criteria (\ac{MLE}, \ac{AIC}, \ac{BIC}, and \ac{EDC} \cite{Dorea:Sim}, \cite{Cabral:Multi}, \cite{Andrei:Meas}). Note that the best statistical modeling is the distribution that achieves the maximum \ac{MLE} value while the best statistical modeling achieves minimum values of whereas for the \ac{AIC}, \ac{BIC}, and \ac{EDC} information criteria. 
	To visualize when an statistical distribution yields the best results in terms of a \ac{MLE} criterion, we use the following parameter:
    \begin{equation}
    \rho_{A} [k] \triangleq \dfrac{\underset{\mathcal{A}}{\max} \,\, \, MLE[k]}{MLE[A,k]},
    \label{eq:log-lik}
    \end{equation}
    in which $ MLE[A,k]$ is the value of the log-likelihood associated with one of the chosen statistical distributions ($A$) belonging to the set of statistical distributions $\mathcal{A}$ for the $k^{th}$ frequency tone. Also, $\underset{\mathcal{A}}{\max} \,\, \, MLE[k]$ is the value of the log-likelihood related to the statistical distribution yielding the best statistical model. The best results are achieved when $\rho_A [k] \rightarrow 1$. Note that $\rho_A [k] \rightleftharpoons \rho_A (\omega) \rightleftharpoons \rho_A (f)$.
	\item \textbf{Step \#3}: Find the statistical distribution yielding the best statistical modeling for the largest number of elements of the \ac{r.v.} $\bf |H|$. %It is important to note that the said distribution must achieve a minimum percentage ratio over the best results yielded by (\ref{eq:log-lik}), for the elements in which the distribution is not the best model, to be considered a valid model over the desired frequency band. 
	In other words, only one statistical distribution is chosen for all elements of the \ac{r.v.} $\bf |H|$. As a results, the set of parameters associated with the statistical distribution is given by $\{\alpha_{1}[0], \cdots, \alpha_{1}[N-1]$,   $\cdots, \alpha_{U}[0], \cdots, \alpha_{U}[N-1]\}$.

    \item \textbf{Step \#4}: Interpolate the set of parameters using the cubic Spline interpolation for obtaining $\alpha_u (\omega) = F_u(\omega; \alpha_{u}[0], \cdots, \alpha_{u}[N-1]), u=1,\cdots,U$. This procedure consists on dividing the desired frequency band into $L$ subbands delimited by $\omega_{l,\textnormal{lower}}$ and $\omega_{l,\textnormal{upper}}$ bounds, and evaluating a third-degree polynomial that describes the $l^{th}$ subband. Note that all subbands address $\omega \in [0,2\pi)$ and the coefficients of the $l^{th}$ polynomial are obtained for each subband following the procedure discussed in \cite{ENA,CS1}.      
\end{itemize}


\section{Numerical Results}

The statistical analyses were carried out by means of two data sets constituted by \ac{CFR} estimates of in-home \ac{PLC} and in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels, which cover the frequency band between $1.7$ and $100$~MHz. These data set were acquired through a measurement campaign, detailed in \cite{Thiago:Characterization,thiago:hyb}. Regarding the \ac{PLC} portion of the measurement campaign, a total of $245$ different combinations of outlets pairs were measured, allowing the acquisition of $148,037$ different \ac{CFR} estimates, with approximately $604$ consecutive \ac{CFR} estimates for each individual measure. Considering the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} portion of the measurement campaign, $293$ different combinations of locations for both hybrid-\ac{PLC} and hybrid-\ac{WLC} transceivers were evaluated. As a result, a total of $175,428$ different \ac{CFR} estimates were acquired, with approximately $600$ consecutive \ac{CFR} estimates for each individual channel acquisition. Two different cases were considered during this scenario, named \textit{short-path channel} and \textit{long-path} channel, respectively. Regarding the \textit{short-path} channel, the \ac{WLC} transceiver was randomly positioned within a $2$~m radius circle centered at the outlet in which the \ac{PLC} transceiver was connected, this scenario was responsible for estimating around $136,683$ \acp{CFR} in $200$ different combinations of locations for both \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} transceivers. On the other hand, in the \textit{long-path} channel scenario, the \ac{WLC} transceiver was randomly placed into an area defined as a swept circle, having an outer and inner radius of $6$~m and $2$~m, respectively, centered in the outlet in which the \ac{PLC} transceiver was connected. This case allowed to obtain $38,745$ \ac{CFR} estimates in $93$ different combinations of locations for both \ac{PLC} and \ac{WLC} transceivers.

The methodology applied to obtain the \ac{CFR} estimate was the one discussed in \cite{Thiago:FR}. It relies on a measurement setup and the use of the \ac{HS-OFDM} scheme \cite{HSOFDM,Picorone}. The measurement setup covers signal generation and acquisition boards, rugged computers, and coupling devices \cite{Luis:AI,Coupling:PLC}, while the \ac{HS-OFDM} scheme is a kind of sounding technique for estimating \ac{CFR} in the discrete time-domain when the data communication is in the baseband. After applying the aforementioned techniques, the average of $L_1\in \mathbb{N}^*, L_2\in \mathbb{N}^*, L_3\in \mathbb{N}^* $ consecutive \ac{CFR} estimates are obtained and then stored as the valid \ac{CFR} estimates for the \ac{PLC}, \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} and \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{long-path} channels. It aims to reduce the impulsive noise influence on the \ac{CFR} estimates.

Note that one \ac{CFR} estimate is obtained during a time interval corresponding to one \ac{HS-OFDM} symbol period $(T_{\textrm{sym}})$ duration and, as a consequence, the time interval duration of the \ac{HS-OFDM} symbol must be shorter than the coherence time of the \ac{PLC} or \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channel. In this context, a channel estimate is obtained every $T_{\textrm{sym}}=(2N + L_{cp}) T_s = 23.04$~$\mu$s, where $N=2048$ is the number of \ac{BPSK} modulated subcarriers of the \ac{HS-OFDM} symbol, $L_{cp}=512$~samples is the length of the so-called \ac{CP}, $f_s=200$~MHz is the sampling rate and $T_s=1/f_s=5$~ns is the sampling period. According to \cite{Canete:AIPLC}, $600~\mu$s is the minimum time period within which the in-home \ac{PLC} channel can be considered time invariant in Spain, while \cite{Thiago:Characterization} pointed out $950~\mu$s apply for the Brazilian in-home \ac{PLC} channels. In addition, \cite{thiago:hyb} showed that  $156~\mu$s and $39.5~\mu$s are the minimum time interval in which the in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} and \textit{long-path} channels, respectively, are time invariant.

Moreover, the assumed value of $N$ and the chosen frequency band (e.g., $1.7-100$~MHz), results in \ac{CFR} estimates with a corresponding frequency resolution of $\Delta f=48.83$~kHz, which is shorter than the coherence bandwidth of Brazilian and Spanish in-home \ac{PLC} channels \cite{Canete:AIPLC,Thiago:Characterization} as well as shorter than the coherence bandwidth of Brazilian in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels \cite{thiago:hyb}. Being shorter than the coherence bandwidth means that each sample of a valid \ac{CFR} estimates is representative for carrying out the statistical analyses. The numerical results are presented in the continuous-time domain rather than the discrete-time one.

The following statistical distributions were adopted: Beta, Birnbaum-Saunders, Gamma, Logistic, Log-normal, Normal, Rayleigh, Rician, t Location-Scale, and Uniform. These distributions are well-established in the telecommunication field and applied to model positive random variables belonging to $\mathbb{R}_+$.

\subsection{In-home PLC channels}\label{sec:MMPLC}

Fig. \ref{respfreq} shows five valid estimates of the \ac{CFR} magnitude. Each valid \ac{CFR} estimate was obtained by averaging  $L_1 = 10$ consecutive \ac{CFR} estimates of in-home \ac{PLC} channels. Note that the channel attenuation ranges from approximately $-30$~dB up to $0$~dB. Also, the in-home \ac{PLC} channels present an irrelevant time-varying behavior during a time interval shorter than $1$~ms once each valid \ac{CFR} estimate covers a time interval of $\Delta T = L_1 T_{\textrm{sym}} \approx 230.4\,\mu$s and $5\Delta T = 1.15$~ms. In other words, the coherence time in an in-home Brazilian PLC channel is larger than in Europe and US, see \cite{Thiago:Characterization}.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/respfreq_1.7.eps}
	\caption{Five consecutive and valid \ac{CFR} Magnitudes of the measured in-home \ac{PLC} channel.}
	\label{respfreq}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{MAG_percent} shows the relative frequency of statistical distributions that had modeled, in accord with the adopted criterion, the magnitude of the whole set of valid \ac{CFR} estimates. It is noted that there is not only a single distribution that models the majority of the magnitudes, but three different statistical distributions stand out as possible candidates to model the \ac{CFR} magnitudes. As a matter of fact, in 35\% of the \ac{CFR} estimates data set the Beta distribution resulted in the best model, in 30\% of it  the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution offered the best modeling and in 24\% of it the Log-normal distribution yielded the best modeling. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/Mag_percent.eps}
	\caption{The relative frequency associated with the chosen statistical distribution that best models the \ac{CFR} magnitude.}
	\label{MAG_percent}
\end{figure}

%In order to evaluate which of the three distributions is the best choice to model the magnitude component of the \ac{CFR} estimates, we use (\ref{eq:log-lik}). 
Fig. \ref{fig:Log_like} shows the values of $\rho_{A}(f)$ for the three best statistical distributions candidates to model the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates. The threshold value $1.2$, corresponding to a deviation of $20\%$ from the best achievable result, was heuristically chosen as the upper bound, indicated by a red dashed line, under which the statistical distribution can be considered good enough to model the \ac{CFR} of in-home \ac{PLC} channels. Note that the vertical axis was limited to the range from $0$ up to $5.0$ to facilitate the visualization and the comparison among the $\rho_{A} (f)$ curves. These curves emphasize the suitability of the Beta distribution to model the samples of the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates. Overall, the results presented in Fig. \ref{MAG_percent} and Fig. \ref{fig:Log_like} strongly support the use of the Beta distribution to model the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates of the measured in-home Brazilian \ac{PLC} channels. This result is different from previous works that had suggested the Log-normal or Rayleigh distributions to model this magnitude, see \cite{Galli:Wireline,RayleighPLC}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\psfrag{AAA}[c][c][0.8]{$\rho_{A} (f)$}

	\caption{The values of $\rho_{A} (f)$ for the Beta, Birnbaun-Saunders and Log-normal distributions.}
	\label{fig:Log_like}
\end{figure}

Based on the aforementioned discussion, we can model the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates by using only one statistical distribution (i.e., the Beta distribution). However, the statistical analysis of the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates shows that each sample of it must be modeled with a set of parameters of the Beta distribution assuming different values. If $\mathcal{C}_{|H_k|} = \{\alpha_{1}[k],\alpha_{2}[k]\}$, where $k=0,1,\cdots,N-1$,  $\alpha_{1}[k] = \alpha[k]$ and $\alpha_{2}[k] = \beta[k]$, are the two parameters ($U=2$) of the Beta distribution associated with the $k$-th sample of the magnitude of a valid \ac{CFR} estimate, then Fig. \ref{mag_example} and Fig. \ref{mag_example2} portrays the statistical models for two different values of frequency: $f=52.1$~MHz ($f = 1067\Delta f$) and $f=78.1$~MHz ($f = 1600\Delta f$), respectively. The parameters of the Beta distribution are  $\alpha(1067 \Delta f) = \alpha_{1}[1067]=0.717$ and $\beta( 1067 \Delta f) = \alpha_{2}[1067] = 10.435$; $\alpha(1600 \Delta f) = \alpha_{1}[1600] = 0.780$ and $\beta( 1600 \Delta f) = \alpha_{2}[1600]=17.772$ for $f=52.1$~MHz and $f=78.1$~MHz, respectively.

	\label{mag_example2}
\end{figure}

By interpolating the parameters values $\alpha(k\Delta f)$ and $\beta(k\Delta f)$ of the Beta distributions, associated with each sampled valid \ac{CFR} estimates, using \textbf{Step \#4} of the proposed enhanced statistical modeling method, we obtain the continuous curves of parameters $\alpha(f)$ and $\beta(f)$, over the desired frequency band $(1.7-100$~MHz). Fig. \ref{Fit_alfa} shows the curve for the parameters $\alpha(f)$ after the cubic Spline interpolation process is applied on the $L=19$ sub-intervals. For the sake of comparison, Fig. \ref{Fit_alfa_poli} illustrates the curves for parameter $\alpha(f)$ obtained, by applying the frequency domain interpolation technique detailed in \cite{mitra} and by using the interpolation technique discussed in \cite{Luis:AI} applied over $L=19$ subbands over the whole frequency bandwidth. On this figure is possible to notice the presence of edge effects that occurs in the boundaries between two polynomials, which are interpolating the values of the parameters in two consecutive frequency subbands. In addition, Fig. \ref{Fit_beta} shows the curve for the parameters $\beta(f)$ after the cubic Spline interpolation process is applied on the $L=19$ sub-intervals.

Furthermore, Table \ref{table_alfa} lists the cubic Spline coefficients for modeling the parameter $\alpha(f)$, of the valid \ac{CFR} magnitude. Similarly, Table \ref{table_beta} lists the cubic Spline coefficients for modeling the parameter $\beta(f)$. As a result, the coefficients values, the waveforms  $\alpha(f)$ and $\beta(f)$, and the Beta distribution define the random process representing the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates, named $|{\bf H}|$, in the continuous-frequency domain.

In order to evaluate the reliability of the presented magnitude model the achievable data rate was estimated for both measured data and \ac{CFR} magnitudes randomly generated by the aforementioned model, over different values of power applied, optimally allocated, and using colorful Gaussian noise \textcolor{red}{[artigo Victor]}. Fig. \ref{Cap_PLC} portrays the two curves of achievable data rate related to the data acquired through the measurement campaign and the proposed model, respectively. By observing the figure it is noticeable the proximity of the curves and also reasonable to affirm that the model curve functions as an upper-bound for the maximum achievable data rate of the measured channels. Therefore the proposed statistical model provides an optimistic, but not far from the truth, set of \ac{CFR} magnitudes of in-home \ac{PLC} channels.

\subsection{Hybrid PLC-WLC short path channels}\label{sec:MMHYBS}

 Fig. \ref{respfreqsW} shows five valid and consecutive estimates of the \ac{CFR} magnitude. Each valid \ac{CFR} estimate was obtained by averaging  $L_2=5$ consecutive \ac{CFR} estimates of the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path}. Note that the channel attenuation ranges from approximately $-40$~dB up to $-10$~dB and, in addition, a small time-varying behavior during a time interval shorter than $550\mu$s is observed, once each valid \ac{CFR} estimate covers a time interval equal to $\Delta T = L_2 T_{\textrm{sym}} \approx 115.2~\mu$s and, as a consequence, $5\Delta T = 576~\mu$s. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Five consecutive and valid CFR Magnitudes of the measured in-home PLC channel.}

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{MAG_percentsW} shows the relative frequency of statistical distributions that had modeled the magnitude of the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} \ac{CFR} estimates. On these plots, it is noticeable a statistical distribution that models the majority of the magnitudes, once that in 54\% of the \ac{CFR} estimates the Log-normal distribution resulted in the best model. However, another different statistical distribution stands out as possible candidate to model the \ac{CFR} magnitudes, since in 30\% of the \ac{CFR} estimates, the Gamma distribution offered the best modeling. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/MAG_percentsW.eps}
	\caption{The relative frequency associated with the chosen statistical distribution that best models the CFR magnitude in accord with the adopted criteria.}
	\label{MAG_percentsW}
\end{figure}

Similar to subsection \ref{sec:MMPLC}, (\ref{eq:log-lik}) was used in order to evaluate which of the two distributions is the best choice to model the magnitude component of the \ac{CFR} estimates. Fig. \ref{fig:Log_likesW} illustrates the values of  $\rho_{A}(f)$ for the two best statistical distributions candidates to model the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates. These curves emphasize that both Log-normal and Gamma distributions achieved the minimum ratio over the \ac{MLE} criterion, in this scenario, the Log-normal distribution was chosen due to the large number of occurrence as the best model for the \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} \ac{CFR} magnitudes, as shown in Fig. \ref{MAG_percentsW}. In other words, the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates of in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} channels is modeled by using only one statistical distribution (i.e., the Log-normal distribution).

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\psfrag{AAA}[c][c][1.0]{$\rho_{A} (f)$}
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/Log_Lognormal_GammasW.eps}
	\caption{The values of $\rho_{A} (f)$ for the Log-normal and Gamma distributions.}
	\label{fig:Log_likesW}
\end{figure}


The statistical analysis of the magnitude of the valid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} \ac{CFR} estimates showed that the parameters of the Log-normal distribution assume different values as frequency changes. If $\mathcal{C}_{|H_k|} = \{\alpha_1[k],\alpha_2[k]\}$ is the set of parameters for the statistical distribution modeling the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates of \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} channels, where $k=0,1,\cdots,N-1$,  $\alpha_1[k] = \mu[k]$ and $\alpha_2[k] = \sigma[k]$, are the two parameters ($U=2$) of the Log-normal distribution, named mean and standard deviation, respectively, associated with the $k$-th sample of the valid \ac{CFR}. Then, Fig. \ref{mag_examplesW} and Fig. \ref{mag_example2sW} portrays the statistical models for two different values of frequency: $f=50.78$~MHz ($k=1040 \rightarrow f = 1040\Delta f$) and $f=80.57$~MHz ($k=1650 \rightarrow f = 1650\Delta f$), respectively. The parameters of the Log-normal distribution are  $\mu(1040 \Delta f) = \alpha_1[1040]=-4.0117$ and $\sigma( 1040 \Delta f) = \alpha_2[1040] = 0.5903$; $\mu(1650 \Delta f) = \alpha_1[1650] = -5.034$ and $\sigma( 1650 \Delta f) = \alpha_2[1650]=0.82$ for $f=50.78$~MHz and $f=80.57$~MHz, respectively.

\end{figure}

By interpolating the parameters values $\mu[k]$ and $\sigma[k]$ of the Log-normal distributions associated with the model of the \ac{CFR} of the hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} channel using $L=15$ subbands, the continuous curves of parameters $\hat{\mu}(\omega)$ and $\hat{\sigma}(\omega)$ are yielded. Finally, the curves $\hat{\mu}(f)$ and $\hat{\sigma}(f)$ are easily obtained once $\omega \in [0,\pi)$ directly corresponds to the frequency band between $0$ and $100$~MHz. Figs. \ref{Fit_alfasW} and \ref{Fit_betasW} illustrates the curves for the parameters $\mu(f)$ and $\sigma(f)$, which are obtained by applying frequency domain interpolation technique detailed in \cite{mitra} and the curves obtained by using the cubic Spline interpolation with $L=15$ subbands. Similar to the previous subsection, Table \ref{table_alfasW} lists the cubic Spline coefficients for modeling the parameter $\mu(f)$, of the valid \ac{CFR} magnitude while Table \ref{table_betasW}, covers the cubic Spline coefficients for modeling the parameter $\sigma(f)$. Overall, it is important to point out that the Log-normal distribution and its parameters waveforms $\hat{\mu(f)}$ and $\hat{\sigma(f)}$ define the random process for the magnitude of the \acp{CFR} of the in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} channel.

\end{figure}

The achievable data rate is used again in order to evaluate the reliability of the presented magnitude model. This time a two datasets of measured noise values, acquired from the measurement campaign, were used in the estimation depending on the signal transmission direction. Figs. \ref{Cap_SP_PLC} and \ref{Cap_SP_WLC} portrays the curves of achievable data rate related to the data acquired through the measurement campaign and the proposed model, denoting the \ac{WLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{PLC} and \ac{PLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{WLC} transmission directions, respectively. In both figures it is noticeable that the curves almost overlap, therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed statistical model provides a reliable set of \ac{CFR} magnitudes of in-home \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} short-path channels.

\subsection{Hybrid PLC-WLC long-path channels}\label{sec:MMHYBL}

Fig. \ref{respfreqlW} shows five valid and consecutive estimates of the \ac{CFR} magnitude. The short duration of the coherence time does not allows us to average consecutive \ac{CFR} estimates of \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{long-path} channels. Note that the channel attenuation ranges from approximately $-45$~dB up to -$15$~dB and the plots cover a time interval equal to $\Delta T_{\textrm{sym}}\approx23.04~\mu$s and, as a consequence, $5\Delta T = 115.2~\mu$s.

Fig. \ref{MAG_percentlW} shows the relative frequency of statistical distributions applied to the magnitudes of the whole set of valid \ac{CFR} estimates. Similar to the results for the \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} channels, a single statistical distribution has modeled the majority of the magnitudes, while another statistical distribution stood out as a possible candidate to model these \ac{CFR} magnitudes. As a matter of fact, in 51\% of the \ac{CFR} estimates the Log-normal distribution resulted in the best model and in 38\% of it the Gamma distribution offered the best modeling.

\end{figure}

Once again (\ref{eq:log-lik}) was used in order to evaluate which of the two distributions is the best choice to model the magnitude component of the \ac{CFR} estimates. Fig. \ref{fig:Log_likelW} portrays the values of  $\rho_{A}(f)$ for the two best statistical distributions candidates to model the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates. These curves emphasize that only the Log-normal distributions achieved the minimum ratio over the \ac{MLE} criterion. Overall, the results in Fig. \ref{MAG_percentlW} and Fig. \ref{fig:Log_likelW} shows that the Log-normal distribution is the best option to model the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates of the measured in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{long-path} channels. In other words, the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates of in-home hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{long-path} channels can be modeled by using only one statistical distribution (i.e., the Log-normal distribution).

	\label{fig:Log_likelW}
\end{figure}

The statistical analysis of the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates shows that the parameters of the Log-normal distribution assume different values as frequency changes. If $\mathcal{C}_{|H_k|} = \{\alpha_1[k],\alpha_2[k]\}$ is the set of parameters for the statistical distribution modeling the magnitude of the valid \ac{CFR} estimates of \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{short-path} channels, where $k=0,1,\cdots,N-1$,  $\alpha_1[k] = \mu[k]$ and $\alpha_2[k] = \sigma[k]$, are the two parameters ($U=2$) of the Log-normal distribution, named mean and standard deviation, respectively, associated with the $k$-th sample of the valid \ac{CFR}. Then, Fig. \ref{mag_examplelW} and Fig. \ref{mag_example2lW} shows the statistical models for two different values of frequency: $f=51.76$~MHz ($k=1060 \rightarrow f = 1060\Delta f$) and $f=78.1$~MHz ($k=1600 \rightarrow f = 1600\Delta f$), respectively. The parameters of the Log-normal distribution are  $\mu(1060 \Delta f) = \alpha_1[1060]=-6.0759$ and $\sigma( 1060 \Delta f) = \alpha_2[1040] = 0.8118$; $\mu(1600 \Delta f) = \alpha_1[1600] = -6.8347$ and $\sigma( 1600 \Delta f) = \alpha_2[1600]=0.8407$ for $f=51.76$~MHz and $f=78.1$~MHz, respectively.

\end{figure}

Through the interpolation of the parameters values $\mu(k\Delta f)$ and $\sigma(k\Delta f)$ of the Log-normal distributions associated with the model of \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{long-path} \ac{CFR} using $L=15$ subbands, the continuous curves of parameters $\hat{\mu}(\omega)$ and $\hat{\sigma}(\omega)$ are yielded. Finally, the curves $\hat{\mu}(f)$ and $\hat{\sigma}(f)$ are easily obtained once $\omega \in [0,\pi)$ directly corresponds to the frequency band between $0$ and $100$~MHz. Figs. \ref{Fit_alfalW} and \ref{Fit_betalW} portrays the curves for the parameters $\mu(f)$ and $\sigma(f)$, which are obtained by applying frequency domain interpolation technique detailed in \cite{mitra} and the curves obtained by using the cubic Spline interpolation with $L=15$ subbands. Furthermore, Table \ref{table_alfalW} lists the cubic Spline coefficients for modeling the parameter $\mu(f)$, of the valid \ac{CFR} magnitude. Similarly, Table \ref{table_betalW} lists the cubic Spline coefficients for modeling the parameter $\sigma(f)$. As a result, the coefficients values, the waveforms  $\hat{\mu(f)}$ and $\hat{\sigma(f)}$, and the Log-normal distribution define the random process representing the magnitude of the \ac{CFR} of the in-home \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} \textit{long-path} channel.

Once again the achievable data rate is used in order to evaluate the reliability of the presented magnitude model. The previously mentioned datasets of measured noise values, acquired from the measurement campaign, were used in the estimation. Figs. \ref{Cap_LP_PLC} and \ref{Cap_LP_WLC} illustrates the curves of achievable data rate related to the data acquired through the measurement campaign and the proposed model, denoting the \ac{WLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{PLC} and \ac{PLC}~$\rightarrow$~\ac{WLC} transmission directions, respectively. Similarly to the results presented in subsection \ref{sec:MMHYBS} in both figures it is noticeable that the curves almost overlap, therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed statistical model provides a reliable set of \ac{CFR} magnitudes of in-home \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} long-path channels.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has introduced statistical modeling of magnitudes of \ac{CFR} of Brazilian in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels, which constitutes an important result to support research efforts for designing \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} systems. The statistical modeling have been relied on data sets of measured \ac{CFR} of in-home channels, covering the frequency band from $1.7$ up to $100$~MHz. 

Numerical results have shown that the proposed method for modeling the magnitudes of the aforementioned channels is suitable. Also, the best modeling for magnitudes of the channel frequency responses of the broadband in-home \ac{PLC} and hybrid \ac{PLC}-\ac{WLC} channels are Beta and Log-normal random processes, respectively, which are non-stationary.
